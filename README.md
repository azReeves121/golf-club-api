# Golf Club Tournament & Membership API

This is a starter Spring Boot project for the golf club tournament and membership API.

It includes:

- Member and Tournament entities with a many-to-many relationship
- Basic REST controllers for creating and listing members and tournaments
- Examples of search endpoints
- An endpoint to add members to tournaments and list all members in a tournament
- Dockerfile and docker-compose for running the app + MySQL

You should **customize and extend** this project to meet your assignment requirements,
especially around search endpoints, validation, error handling, and AWS RDS configuration.
